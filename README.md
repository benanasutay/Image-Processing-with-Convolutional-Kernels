# Image Convolution Operations

This project demonstrates the application of different convolution operations on an image. Using various kernels, the script applies edge detection, sharpening, blurring, and other image filters to transform the input image. The results are displayed for visual comparison.

## Overview

The script performs several convolution operations on a grayscale image, including:

1. **Edge Detection (Kernel 1)**: Detects edges in the image using a specific edge detection kernel.
2. **Edge Detection (Kernel 2)**: A different edge detection kernel for comparison.
3. **Image Sharpening**: Enhances the image by emphasizing high-frequency details.
4. **Box Blur**: A simple blurring operation using a box blur kernel.
5. **Gaussian Blur (3x3)**: A Gaussian blur applied using a 3x3 kernel.
6. **Gaussian Blur (5x5)**: A more extended Gaussian blur applied using a 5x5 kernel.

Each filter is applied using a custom convolution function, and the results are visualized to show the effects of each operation.
